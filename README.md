# derivative calulator
    made this project to understand parsing 

# making this
I initially thought of using libraries to evaluate the mathematical expressions using libraries but
since i'll be dealing with symbols of some sort, maybe it's feasible if i wrote a parser/tokenizer from scratch
since I had some idea on how to write a tokenizer or parser from previous small projects.
So...
- I'll be writing a tokenizer and parser from scratch
lets see how that goes
