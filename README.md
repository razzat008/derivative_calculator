# derivative calulator
    made this project to understand parsing 

# making this
I initially thought of using libraries to evaluate the mathematical expressions using libraries but
since i'll be dealing with symbols of some sort, maybe it's feasible if i wrote a parser/tokenizer from scratch
since I had some idea on how to write a tokenizer or parser from previous small projects.
So...
- I'll be writing a tokenizer and parser from scratch
lets see how that goes (it did not go well)

# update 1 (2025-06-21)
- currently working on the tokenizer (still) i focused more on writing better code instead of just programming it out
 I'm taking references from the docs and existing tokenizers lets see how this goes
# update 2 (2025-07-07)
- I've taken the tokenizer present on mkdb as reference for this and modified it 
- I've followed the [Recursive Descent Parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser)  parsing method for this project
